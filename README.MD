# Advanced DSA Practice â€“ Trees to Tries

This repository holds my solutions to intermediate and advanced-level Data Structures and Algorithms problems. These include trees, graphs, tries, heaps, greedy algorithms, and more.

## ðŸ›  Whatâ€™s Inside

- Organized by topics in separate folders
- Code-only solutions focused on applying core concepts
- Written entirely in **C++**

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This repo is part of my personal DSA journey, built to:
- Tackle complex problems and advanced patterns
- Strengthen depth in problem-solving
- Reinforce core CS concepts like recursion, traversal, and graph algorithms

## ðŸ§­ Topics Covered

- Trees
- Graphs
- Tries
- Heaps
- Advanced Sorting Techniques
- Greedy Algorithms
- Miscellaneous High-Level DSA
